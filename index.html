        I have been actively developing working software for 1 year, for the last 7 months I've been on a front-end dev team for a fortune 500 company 
        developing a micro-product for integration into a high priority enterprise platform. My professional experience, prior to my entry into the 
        tech world, is in business management and customer service. My unique background paired with technical skill has given me the ability to 
        communicate easily between fellow engineers and PO's, lead team interactions and demo for stakeholders.
        I'd love to find a company that values active and sincere mentorship, one that recognizes the more you invest in your employees, 
        the more they invest in you. I'm looking to find a work home where they foster an organic career path and encourage employees to seek 
        fulfillment both inside and outside the organization. I strive to have an Agile mindset and prefer my work environment also be Agile. 
        I value diversity, inclusivity, and celebration of differences, the ability to come to work as my full and authentic self is very important to me. 
        Invest in me, challenge and encourage me, give me a feedback loop and I will fully invest in you. I look forward to meeting with you soon.
